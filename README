This homebrew will check all your installed NAND titles and compare them to the
ones that "should" be installed on 9.2.0-20U. It will display any differences
when checking but it will also output them to a file called "check.log" inside
this homebrew's folder.

version 2.0 adds:
- organized formatted 3ds output with title descriptons from yls8.mtheall.com
- change.log output also revamped for tidyness
- decimal version #'s instead of hex as this is what 3dbrew.org uses
- readable title list log 'installed_titles.log' for a detailed inventory of your 3ds NAND
- rename any title list binary to default.bin and it will be selected regardless of system firmware
for devs:
- _titleListExtract.py to extract a title list binary from an update pack
- index.html to get title struct info for description.h from yls8.mtheall.com. see file for details
