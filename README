This homebrew will check all your installed NAND titles and compare them to the
ones that "should" be installed on your system. It will display any differences
when checking but it will also output them to a file called "check.log" inside
this homebrew's folder.

It currently supports versions:
  * N3DS 9.0.0-20E/J/U
  * N3DS 9.1.0-20J
  * N3DS 9.2.0-20E/J/U
  * O3DS 9.0.0-20E/J/U
  * O3DS 9.2.0-20E/J/U
